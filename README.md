# Linear-Regression-With-Keras
This is a linear regression model by using Keras Library for predicting whether cement is strong or not by training model on different - different 8 paramters.
this is not same regression as we learned in machine learning, this is quite different as keras is used for deeplearning.
Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library. Up until version 2.3, Keras supported multiple backends, including TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, etc.
